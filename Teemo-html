<p class="pinfo">
As a young Yordle, Teemo was fascinated by the natural world and developed a keen sense of curiosity about the flora and fauna of Valoran, the world in which League of Legends takes place. He became particularly interested in the various poisons and toxins that could be found in nature, and he became an expert in their use.
</p>
<p class="pinfo">
Teemo eventually joined the military forces of Bandle City, where he served as a scout and a sniper. His skills in poison-making and stealth made him an ideal choice for reconnaissance missions, and he quickly became one of the most valuable members of the Yordle army.
  </p>
<p class="pinfo">
During one mission, Teemo stumbled upon a hidden enemy base and was captured. He endured months of torture and interrogation, but refused to reveal any information about Bandle City or his comrades. Eventually, Teemo managed to escape and make his way back to Bandle City.
  </p>
<p class="pinfo">
After the war ended, Teemo retired from active duty and focused on teaching the next generation of scouts. He also became a farmer and used his knowledge of plants to help improve crop yields in Bandle City. Despite his retirement, Teemo remains one of Bandle City's most beloved heroes, known for his bravery, skill, and kindness.
